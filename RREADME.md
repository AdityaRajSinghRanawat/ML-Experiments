# Machine Learning Lab

A collection of machine learning experiments and implementations from my university coursework.

## About

This repository contains practical implementations of machine learning algorithms and techniques covered in my ML lab sessions. Each experiment explores fundamental concepts and applies them to real-world datasets.

## Purpose

- Document hands-on learning in machine learning
- Implement core ML algorithms from scratch
- Explore various ML libraries and frameworks
- Build a foundation in practical machine learning

## What You'll Find Here

Each experiment includes the problem statement, dataset information, implementation code, and analysis of results. The focus is on understanding the underlying mathematics and logic behind each algorithm while developing practical coding skills.

## Topics

Experiments cover supervised learning, unsupervised learning, regression, classification, clustering, neural networks, model evaluation, feature engineering, and other fundamental machine learning concepts.

## Tools & Technologies

Google Colab, Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and other relevant ML libraries.
